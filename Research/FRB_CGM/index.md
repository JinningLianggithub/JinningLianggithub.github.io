## Measuring the circumgalactic gas with fast radio bursts

[ADS link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220904455W/abstract)

The distribution of gas around galaxies is poorly constrained and is sensitive to galaxy formation feedback processes.  FRBs provide a unique probe of the CGM through the integrated electron density along the line of sight -- the dispersion measure (DM).  As one of the first few attempts in this direction, we measured the excess DM of nearby (<100 Mpc) low-mass ($$10^{11}-10^{13}\ M_\odot$$) halos using CHIME FRBs by establishing a novel weighted stacking method.  We found a 1-2 $$\sigma$$ detection of the excess DM at <1-2 virial radii with the current sample of 500 FRBs.  With 2000-3000 more FRBs from future CHIME data release, we predict a 4-$$\sigma$$ detection, which should be even more significant given the much better localization in the near future.
