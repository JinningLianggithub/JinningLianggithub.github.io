## A non-parametric Lagrangian halo biasing model

[ADS link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210913948W/abstract)

Halos are traditionally assumed to be biased tracers of the large-scale structure, and their clustering can be modeled as a polynomial of the matter density field with a few unknown bias coefficients. However, the much rarer and more highly biased nature of reionization-epoch halos indicates a regime where this bias expansion method likely fails significantly. For instance, it may predict a negative number of halos or a sizable amount of halos in underdense regions.

As the first attempt ever to jump out of the traditional bias expansion framework, I developed a novel non-parametric halo biasing model and tested it using the well-studied z=0.5 halos in the AbacusSummit simulations. I obtained a non-parametric function that describes how many halos a given patch in the initial space should form, and found that this function deviates significantly from a polynomial of the matter density. More biased halos observe larger deviations, and my non-parametric model can outperform the bias expansion at recovering the halo power spectrum. I am now extending this formalism to study halos at redshift 8-30 and will examine the large-scale structure at the reionization epoch. I will address issues such as how many halos lie within an ionized region, which is crucial for reionization feedback but has never been studied before.

More figures to come later...
