## Galaxy Chemical Evolution


At the beginning of the universe, there were only H, He, and small amounts of Li. The first stars formed from these elements and began to fuse them into heavier elements like C, N, and O. As these stars evolved and eventually exploded they dispersed these heavier elements into the surrounding gas and dust, enriching it with new elements. Over time, subsequent generations of stars formed from this enriched gas, incorporating even more heavy elements into their composition. As galaxies continue to evolve and merge, the chemical composition of their stars and gas mix and become more complex
