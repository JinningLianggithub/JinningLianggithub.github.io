I am a 4th year PhD student at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, originally from Beijing. I work with Matt McQuinn and Daniel Eisenstein on [reionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization) and the intergalactic medium, using both simulations and analytic calculations. Check out my [research](/Research/) page and my [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaohanzai) profile!

I did my undergrad at Peking University, where I completed my first project on star clusters. For my undergrad thesis, I worked with my advisor from the neighboring university 300 meters away (Tsinghua) on prolate galaxies and their dynamics. I also had a four-month intership at University of Arizona, where I worked on extreme emission line galaxies. When in Tucson, I got a chance to go up to Kitt Peak and observe for the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey. Unfortunately that became my last experience as an observer, because I realized I cannot get used to sleeping during the day...

Outside astronomy, I am an amateur ballet dancer. So I spend most of my spare time on ballet classes and watching performances. I am also a huge fan of Sci-Fi, and I love The Three-Body Problem!
