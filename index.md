My name is Jinning Liang, a first-year PhD student at Durham University. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Wuhan University, China. I study AGN, galaxies, dark matter halos, cosmology, large scale structure and the relations among them using cosmological simulations and semi-analytical models. Specifically, I am interested in the topics of galactic dynamics, galaxy structure, galaxy chemical evolution, galaxy formation history, extreme galaxies, and the nature of dark matter. Although I spend most of my time focusing on theoretical work, I also pay attention to observational data and sometimes combine them with simulations. Prior these work, I have also done research about gravitational lensing computation.
