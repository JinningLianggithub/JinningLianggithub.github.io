I am a 5th year PhD student at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, originally from Beijing.  I work with Matt McQuinn and Daniel Eisenstein on various things.  I have been mostly working on reionization and the intergalactic medium (IGM), but I am extending my research into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  I am also interested in fast radio bursts and their applications in cosmology and CGM studies.  As a theorist who has been running simulations and performing analytic calculations, I am starting to explore more of real observational data and compare them with theoretical models.  Check out my [research](/Research/) page and my [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaohanzai) profile!

I did my undergrad at Peking University, where I completed my first project on star clusters.  For my undergrad thesis, I worked with my advisor from the neighboring university 300 meters away (Tsinghua) on prolate galaxies and their dynamics.  I also had a four-month intership at University of Arizona, where I worked on extreme emission line galaxies.  When in Tucson, I got a chance to go up to Kitt Peak and observe for the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey.  Unfortunately that became my last experience as an observer, because I realized I cannot get used to sleeping during the day...

Outside astronomy, I am an amateur ballet dancer.  I spend most of my spare time in ballet classes and watching performances.  (People may not understand this, but ballet is such an important part of my life that I go find local ballet classes even when I am visiting other schools and attending conferences...)  I am also a huge fan of Sci-Fi, and I love The Three-Body Problem!
