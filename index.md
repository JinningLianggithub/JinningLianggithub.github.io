My name is Jinning Liang, a senior undergraduate at Wuhan University. I study galaxies, dark matter halos, cosmology, large scale structure and the relations among them using cosmological simulations and semi-analytical models. Specifically, I am interested in the topics of galactic dynamics, galaxy structure, galaxy chemical evolution, galaxy formation history, extreme galaxies, the nature of dark matter. Although I spend most of my time focusing on theoretical work, I also pay attention to observational data and sometimes combine them with simulations.
