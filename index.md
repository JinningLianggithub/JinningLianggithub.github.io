I am a postdoc fellow at the Canadian Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, originally from Beijing.  I studied reionization and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during my PhD at Harvard, but I am extending my research into the circumgalactic medium (CGM). My main focus now is to explore fast radio bursts (FRB) as a probe of the CGM, as well as measuring the CGM using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  As a theorist who has been running simulations and performing analytic calculations, I spend half of my time now on dealing with real observational data and comparing them with theoretical models.  Check out my [research](/Research/) page and my [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaohanzai) profile!

I am also interested in visualizations and science outreach with virtual and augmented reality.  I learned unity in 2022.  Send me a DM if you are interested in collaborating on related things!

Outside astronomy, I am an amateur ballet dancer.  I spend most of my spare time in ballet classes and watching performances.  (People may not understand this, but ballet is such an important part of my life that I go find local ballet classes even when I am visiting other schools and attending conferences...)  I am also a huge fan of Sci-Fi, and I love The Three-Body Problem!
